This DirectX program displays the waveform of an audio file in real time, similar to the Windows Media Player visualizer. It will read any 16-bit audio file, such as many .wav and .mp3 files. It uses the same basic code as the music game demo, and could be integrated into it as a background. The program can also read the frequency spectrum of the audio in addition to the waveform, by performing a Fourier transform on the audio data values as they are collected. This allows the visualizer to react to whether high or low frequencies are dominant in the sound, which is represented by colouring the graph; there is also the option to visualize the frequency values in a bar graph.

The first audio sample is from http://first-unitarian.com/audio/debussy-first-arabesque.mp3, and the second is from Destination Unknown by Renard. I do not own them, and they are used only for demonstration purposes.

To compile the program in Visual Studio, add the headers and .cpp files to a blank Win32 project and add the Include folder from the Microsoft DirectX SDK to the Visual C++ include directories.  It is also necessary to add the d3d9.lib and d3dx9.lib files from the Lib/x86 folder in the SDK to the additional dependencies in the linker input options, along with strmiids.lib.  To run the program, the included image and audio files need to be added to the project directory as well.
